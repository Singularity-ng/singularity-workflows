## Test Suite Analysis

### Test Breakdown by Category

| Category | Tests | Type | Status |
|----------|-------|------|--------|
| Schema validation | 130+ | Integration | ✅ |
| Workflow definition | 46 | Unit + Integration | ✅ |
| Run initialization | 20 | Integration | ✅ |
| Step state management | 48 | Unit | ✅ |
| Step task handling | 60+ | Unit | ✅ |
| Step dependencies | 18 | Unit | ✅ |
| Task executor | 51 | Integration | ✅ |
| Dynamic workflows | 57 | Integration | ✅ |

### Testing Approach
- **Chicago-Style TDD**: Tests verify final database state, not implementation details
- **Integration Testing**: All tests use real PostgreSQL with pgmq
- **Sandbox Isolation**: Each test runs in isolated transaction
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Happy path, error cases, edge cases, concurrency
