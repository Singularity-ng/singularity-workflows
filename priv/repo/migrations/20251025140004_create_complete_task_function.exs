defmodule Pgflow.Repo.Migrations.CreateCompleteTaskFunction do
  @moduledoc """
  Creates complete_task() PostgreSQL function for DAG coordination.

  This is the most critical function in the DAG system. It:
  1. Marks a task as completed
  2. Decrements the step's remaining_tasks counter
  3. When remaining_tasks reaches 0, marks step as completed
  4. Cascades to dependent steps by decrementing their remaining_deps
  5. Triggers start_ready_steps to awaken newly ready steps

  Matches pgflow's cascading completion mechanism.
