## 🔧 How It Works

### YAML Configuration
The scripts leverage ex_llm's YAML configuration system located in `../../packages/ex_llm/config/models/`:

- **Provider-specific files:** `anthropic.yml`, `openai.yml`, `gemini.yml`, etc.
- **Model definitions:** Context windows, pricing, capabilities, deprecation dates
- **Optimization data:** Cost per 1M tokens, capability flags, performance metrics

### ExLLM Integration
The scripts use ex_llm's core modules:

```elixir
# List all models
ExLLM.Core.Models.list_all()

# Get model details
ExLLM.Core.Models.get_info(:anthropic, "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")

# Find by capabilities
ExLLM.Core.Models.find_by_capabilities([:vision, :streaming])

# Find by cost range
ExLLM.Core.Models.find_by_cost_range(input: {0, 5.0}, output: {0, 20.0})
```

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Cost Optimization
- Filters models by maximum cost per 1M tokens
- Sorts by input cost (cheapest first)
- Identifies best value models

#### 2. Performance Optimization
- Filters by minimum context window size
- Sorts by context window (largest first)
- Considers capability richness

#### 3. Balanced Optimization
- Combines cost and performance scores
- Weighted scoring system
- Configurable cost/performance ratio

#### 4. Capability Optimization
- Filters by required capabilities
- Sorts by capability count
- Use-case specific recommendations

## 📊 Key Statistics

From our analysis of 1,167+ models across 50+ providers:

- **Cheapest Model:** $0.02/1M tokens (text-embedding-3-small)
- **Most Expensive Model:** $150/1M tokens (o1-pro)
- **Average Cost:** $4.01/1M tokens
- **Largest Context Window:** 10,000,000 tokens
- **Most Common Capability:** Streaming (910 models)
- **Providers with Most Models:** Bedrock (160), OpenAI (110), Azure (108)

## 🔗 Nexus Integration

The ex_llm package is fully integrated with the Nexus LLM router:

```elixir
# Nexus uses ex_llm for model selection
{:ok, response} = Nexus.LLMRouter.route(%{
  complexity: :complex,
  messages: [%{role: "user", content: "Design a system"}],
  task_type: :architect
})
```

**Current Nexus Model Selection Logic:**
- `:simple` → Gemini Flash (free, fast)
- `:medium` → Claude Sonnet or GPT-4o  
- `:complex` → Claude Sonnet (with Codex fallback)

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Model Listing
```bash
# Quick overview
elixir simple_models_list.exs

# Detailed analysis
elixir list_models.exs

# YAML demonstration
elixir direct_yaml_demo.exs
```

### Advanced Optimization
```bash
# Advanced optimization strategies
elixir optimize_models.exs

# Complete integration summary
elixir models_integration_summary.exs
```

### Integration with Your Code
```elixir
# Use ExLLM directly
{:ok, models} = ExLLM.Core.Models.list_all()
{:ok, vision_models} = ExLLM.Core.Models.find_by_capabilities([:vision])

# Use through Nexus
{:ok, response} = Nexus.LLMRouter.route(%{
  complexity: :complex,
  messages: [%{role: "user", content: "Design a system"}],
  task_type: :architect
})
```

    get_latency_score(model)
  end)
end
```

### Custom Use Case Filters
```elixir
defp find_models_for_code_generation(models) do
  models
  |> Enum.filter(fn model ->
    capabilities = model.capabilities
    :function_calling in capabilities and 
    (model.context_window || 0) >= 50_000
  end)
  |> Enum.sort_by(fn model -> model.pricing["input"] || 999999.0 end)
end
```
